# Describes the level of tree in the following order 
build-tree-by : 
  - device-stream
  - data-set
  - ampHoldSignal

# (1)
# Discribes the node device-stream
#
# varagin - can take parameters to be added in nodeData struct 
# and the equivalent value will be looked up from cell data
#
# featureExtractor is a function handle that has all its child nodes
# extractDataSummary - might look up all the nodeData from child nodes and 
# extracts some meaning full feature and returns it back
